# snake-game
This contains code for a basic snake game.  
You control snake with arrow keys.  
Pressing space bar pauses and unpauses the game.  
I created this after watching this tutorial on Youtube.

There are 3 classes: GameFrame, GamePanel and SnakeGame. GameFrame has code relating to the JFrame, SnakeGame contains the main method to run the application and the rest of the code resides in GamePanel.
